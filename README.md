**Open-Antigravity** is not just another code editor or AI assistant. It's an ambitious open-source project to build a web-native, **agent-first** integrated development environment (IDE). Unlike proprietary platforms that lock you into a single AI ecosystem, Open-Antigravity is designed from the ground up to be a **universal gateway to any LLM**. Our goal is to create a platform where developers can delegate complex tasks to autonomous AI agents, powered by the models of their choice.

This project is for you if you believe in:
- **True Model Freedom:** Building a future that isn't tied to a single AI provider.
- **Democratizing AI:** Making state-of-the-art agentic development accessible to everyone.
- **Transparency & Extensibility:** Creating an open core that the community can shape, extend, and trust.
- **Self-Hosting & Privacy:** Giving you full control over your code, your data, and your AI connections.

## ✨ Core Features (The Vision)

We aim to build a platform that redefines developer productivity. Here are the key features we are building towards:

- **🌌 Best of All Worlds:** Aims to fuse the best features of Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, Kiro, Trae, Trae CN, Qoder, and Antigravity into a single, cohesive experience.

- **✨ Google's Cutting Edge:** Incorporates the powerful code-mending capabilities of **Google CodeMender** and the advanced reasoning of **Google Jules** to provide state-of-the-art code generation, debugging, and understanding.

- **🔒 Privacy First:** No code information, environment information, OS information or user information or usage pattern would be sent to google.

- **🔌 Universal LLM Gateway:**
  Break free from vendor lock-in. Open-Antigravity is designed as a universal translation layer for Large Language Models. Connect to anything from OpenAI's GPT-5, Anthropic's Claude, and Google's Gemini to open models like Llama, Grok, and Qwen, or specialized APIs like Deepseek and Kimi. A unified interface means your agents and tools work seamlessly across all of them.

- **🤖 Agent-First Workflow:**
  Delegate high-level tasks like "implement a new API endpoint for user authentication" or "refactor the database schema and update all related services" to AI agents powered by your chosen LLM.

- **🧠 Multi-Agent Collaboration:**
  Spawn multiple agents that can work in parallel or collaborate on a single goal. For example, one agent writes the code, a second writes the tests, and a third verifies the changes in a browser.

- **🌐 Dual-View Interface:**
  - **Editor View:** A feature-rich, AI-supercharged IDE based on **VS Code (VSCodium)** for when you want to get hands-on.
  - **Manager View:** A dedicated surface to spawn, orchestrate, monitor, and manage your fleet of AI agents as they work across different parts of your codebase.

- **✅ Trust Through Verifiable Artifacts:**
  To build trust in autonomous work, agents don't just produce logs. They generate tangible **Artifacts**:
  - **Task Lists & Plans:** Review the agent's plan before it starts.
  - **Screenshots & Recordings:** Visually verify UI changes made by an agent.
  - **Test Results:** See concrete proof that the agent's code meets the requirements.

- **🔄 Interactive Feedback Loop:**
  Provide feedback to agents in real-time. Comment on an artifact, correct a line of code, or adjust the plan, and the agent will incorporate your feedback without losing context.

## 🏛️ High-Level Architecture

Open-Antigravity is being designed as a modular, container-native application that you can run anywhere.

```

- **Web UI:** A responsive frontend providing the editor and agent management interfaces.
- **Gateway & Orchestrator:** The central brain that interprets user requests, dispatches tasks to agents, and manages workflows.
- **Workspace Manager:** Provisions and manages isolated, containerized development environments for agents to safely work in.
- **AI Model Gateway:** A standardized interface to connect to various large language models.

## 🚀 Roadmap

Our roadmap is a living document. For a detailed breakdown of upcoming features, technical specifications, and timelines, please see our full [**ROADMAP.md**](./ROADMAP.md).

Here is a high-level overview of the key phases:

- **Phase 1: Core Platform & Universal Gateway**
  - [ ] Design and build the **Universal AI Model Gateway** with a pluggable provider architecture.
  - [ ] Implement initial connectors for major APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) and a local model runner.
  - [ ] Foundational backend services (Orchestrator, Workspace Manager).
  - [ ] Core web UI with an integrated VSCodium-based editor.

- **Phase 2: Single-Agent Workflow & Tooling**
  - [ ] Development of the Agent Orchestrator to manage agent lifecycles.
  - [ ] Implementation of a general-purpose agent capable of file I/O and command execution.
  - [ ] Introduction of the "Verifiable Artifacts" system (e.g., task lists, execution plans).

- **Phase 3: Advanced Agentic Features**
  - [ ] Multi-agent collaboration and orchestration via the "Manager View".
  - [ ] Introduction of specialized agents (e.g., Tester, Code Reviewer).
  - [ ] Self-healing and interactive feedback mechanisms for agents.

- **Phase 4: Community & Extensibility**
  - [ ] Public plugin API for custom tools, models, and agents.
  - [ ] A community marketplace for sharing and discovering plugins.
  - [ ] Enhanced support for complex, multi-repository projects.

## 🛠️ Getting Started (Development)

The repository now includes a runnable MVP skeleton composed of:
- `services/orchestrator` (minimal API gateway + task/model/workspace stubs)
- `services/web` (minimal manager/editor UI that calls the orchestrator)
- `mitmserver` (request interception tool used independently)

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker and Docker Compose plugin (`docker compose`)
- Node.js v20+ (only needed if you run services without Docker)

**Installation:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ishandutta2007/open-antigravity.git
    cd open-antigravity
    ```

2.  **Setup environment variables:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3.  **Launch the MVP skeleton:**
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```

4.  **Open the services:**
    - Web UI: `http://localhost:3000`
    - Orchestrator API health: `http://localhost:4000/health`

5.  **Run MITM proxy separately (optional):**
    ```bash
    cd mitmserver
    npm ci
    npm start
    ```
